# Creatable Game
Creatable game is a game built around the idea that the player, if he
knows enough about his world, can reshape it to fit his needs. Everything
in this game is created using objects that the player can learn about and
eventually mould to fit his needs.

## Getting Started
This game is built around the creatable object class, a class that enables
for infinite scaling of the objects in the game, meaning that this game is
ready to go right now, or could have a team of developers working with for
hundreds of years and the core mechanics could be the same. This framework
is used to provide a means for the player to learn to interact with and
build their world in a much more interactive way than most games allow for.
Rather than an encounter with an enemy ending when a player has vanquished
their foe, an encounter could end when a player sets the enemy's health to
a negative number. This kind of interactive problem solving encourages the
player to interact with game files, as the only lasting solution is to
"know thy enemy". 

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- Game                (source code folder)
+-- Program.cs          (program entry point)    
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
